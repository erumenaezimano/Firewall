## Firewall Security

This project focuses on enhancing firewall security by implementing machine learning algorithms to predict and analyse network traffic. 
Two algorithms, Random Forest Classifier and Naives Bayes, were used to predict and prevent potentially malicious activities within the network. 
The project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of firewall systems in safeguarding against unauthorised access and potential cyber-threats.
